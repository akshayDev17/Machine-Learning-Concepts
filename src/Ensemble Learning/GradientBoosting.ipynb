    "# Gradient Boosting Regression\n",
    "1. chain of models, where the successive models are trained on the *mistakes* of the preceding ones\n",
    "2. begin with a mean-value model: mean of target value across all training samples = estimated value\n",
    "    1. this mean value model will be called $\\mathbf{F_0(x)}$\n",
    "    2. calculate pseudoresiduals:\n",
    "        1. for each sample in the training set, find PR = $y_i - \\hat{y}_i$, and since $\\hat{y}_i = \\bar{y}$, \n",
    "            1. notice that the regression loss function, MSE, = $\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^N\\dfrac{(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}{N}$, and $\\nabla \\mathcal{L} = -2\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^N\\dfrac{(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)}{N} = 2\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^N\\dfrac{(\\hat{y}_i - y_i)}{N}$\n",
    "            2. notice the relation between the gradient of the loss function for a given sample, and the pseuoresidual of that sample.\n",
    "            3. this is why, pseudoresidual is the negative gradient of MSE (regression loss function)\n",
    "    3. use the pseudoresiduals as the **labels** that would be predicted by the successor model\n",
    "3. usually DecisionTrees will be used as the weak learners after this mean-value model\n",
    "4. a weak learner, i.e. a shallow decision tree , with small no. of nodes, is used:\n",
    "    1. this is the first weak learner, i.e. $\\mathbf{h_1(x)}$ and will now be fit on the original training data but using the PR's from the preceding model as the target.\n",
    "    2. the predictions from this learner ($\\mathbf{h_1(x)}$) will now be calculated.\n",
    "    3. the prediction of the actual target variable at this stage, as given by the gradient boosting model built until now, will be $\\mathbf{F_1(x)} = \\mathbf{F_0(x)} + \\eta\\times\\mathbf{h_1(x)}$, where $\\eta$: learning rate hyperparameter.\n",
    "    4. PR($F_1(x_i)$) = $y_i - F_1(x_i)$\n",
    "    5. this will now serve as the target to train model 2, i.e. $h_2(x)$, upon which $\\mathbf{F_2(x)} = \\mathbf{F_0(x)} + \\eta\\times\\mathbf{h_1(x)} + \\eta\\times\\mathbf{h_2(x)} = F_1(x) + + \\eta\\times\\mathbf{h_2(x)}$\n",
    "    6. this is continued\n",
    "    7. **Note:** that the samples in the nodes of these weak learners will have the pseudoresiduals from the previous learners within them, as opposed to the target variable y values that are generally stored in the nodes of a tree based algorithm/ensemble.\n",
    "5. so after adding M models, $\\mathcal{F}(x) = F_0(x) + \\sum\\limits_{m=1}^M \\eta.h_m(x)$\n",
    "6. **no bootstrapping, aggregation == boosting:**\n",
    "7. **gradient** because the model gradually moves in the direction of the steepest descent w.r.t. the loss function, **boosting** due to the sequential combination of predictions from weak learners.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical intuition\n",
    "- observe that for a perfect model with only 1 weak learner\n",
    "    - the mean-value model will make some errors, which will be accurately predicted by the 1st weak learner\n",
    "    - if learning rate = 1, $F_1(x) = y$ (think)\n",
    "- if say the first weak learner wasn't perfect, but the 2nd learner was:\n",
    "    - $F_2(x) = y$ (think)\n",
    "- the basic idea behind the successive weak learner being trained using the residual of the previous weak learner is to minimize the eventual residual\n",
    "    - observe that each new learner will theoretically take the residual as closer to 0 as it can.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why all underlying estimators are weak?\n",
    "- to control overfitting, they are essentially *weak*\n",
    "- either tree depth is constrained, or no. of leaf nodes. (Basically any sort of hyperparametric pre-pruning)\n",
    "- each weak learner: computationally less expensive to train\n",
    "- diversity: since the target is changing, different patterns are being learnt by each added weak learner.\n",
    "- *weakness* is a form of regularizing DTs\n",
    "- `subsample` in [`sklearn.GradientBoostingRegressor`](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor.html) can be used to only use a random subset of samples to train the weak learners. <font color=\"red\">Check if for each new weak learner does the sampling take place, or is it done once and then this subset is used for all weak learners!!</font>\n",
    "- <font color=\"red\">Why `freidman_mse` over `mse`?</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why learning rate?\n",
    "- low learning rate: more no. of models added <font color=\"red\">Test this!</font>\n",
    "- smoothens the learning process\n",
    "- just another method of reducing the risk of overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "## Convergence\n",
    "- Hyperparameter based\n",
    "    - `n_estimators`: once these many estimators are built, job done. allows till `inf`.\n",
    "    - `warm_start = True`\n",
    "    - `n_iter_no_change`: performs early stopping if validation score doesn't improve till for these many iterations. `validation_fraction` by default is `0.1`, so we already have a validation set within the model.\n",
    "    - `tol`: tolerance for early stopping, the minimum improvement in validation score to constitute a change "
