  - But if we could average a huge number of estimates of mu-cap obtained from a huge number of sets of observations, then this average would exactly equal mu. 
- if we estimate the beta-parameters, on the basis of a particular data set, then our estimates wonâ€™t be exactly equal to the true value of beta-parameters, i.e. their values in the true function. 
  - But if we could average the estimates obtained over a huge number of data sets, then the average of these estimates would be spot on!

- sigma is the standard deviation of each of the realizations y-sub-i of Y.
- its assumed that all y-sub-i's are independent and identically distributed, here y-1 just means the first sample's Y value, it doesn't mean a particular value, as the dataset could be shuffled row-wise, hence y-1 can have any of the sample values. similar is the argument for all other y-sub-i's.
- this deviation shrinks with n, the more observations we have, the smaller the standard error of  **mu-cap( ![This is the rendered form of the equation. You can not edit this directly.

# Standard errors for the beta-parameters<a name="standard-error-beta"></a>

- since y-sub-i = beta-0 + beta-1 times x-sub-i + epsilon-sub-i, where beta-0 and beta-1 are assumed to be constants.
  - additionally, its also assumed that X-sub-i are also all constants, because in reality, for the given ML problem, those are constant, and aren't randomly decided.
  - what is randomly occurring is the epsilon-sub-i , i.e. the irreducible error term.
  - moreover, Y-sub-i is also unknown for the test-samples, and also its relation with beta-0 + beta-1 times X-sub-i is unknown, hence its safe to assume that since epsilon-sub-i is random, Y-sub-i is also random.

* since all X-sub-i's are constant, their mean, X-bar, will also be constant, hence the sum of squares of the difference between X-sub-i and X-bar over all i's, from 1 to n, is also constant, and hence can be pulled out from the expression of the variance.

- Notice that the standard error for the slope parameter, i.e. beta-1-hat, is smaller when the x-sub-i are more spread out; intuitively we have more leverage to estimate a slope when this is the case.

- A value between 0 and 1, this **metric of accuracy** is independent of the scale of the dependent variable.

  - TSS measures the total variance in the response Y , and can be squares thought of as the amount of variability inherent in the response before the regression is performed. 
  - In contrast, RSS measures the amount of variability that is left unexplained after performing the regression. 
  - Hence, **TSS - RSS** measures the  amount of variability in the response that is explained (or removed) by performing the regression.
-  A number near 0 indicates the linear model is wrong, or the inherent, i.e. irreducible error, ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cdpi%7B120%7D%20%5Csigma%5E2%28%5Cin%29)  is high, or both.

- while t-statistic is used to  tell you if a *single* variable is statistically significant, this test is used to test if a *group* of variables are jointly significant.

  - ### Degrees of Freedom in Statistics<a name="dof"></a>

    - degrees of freedom is the effective number of parameters of the model required to **even estimate the regression**, i.e. the slope(a vector of dimensions p) and the coefficient.

    - [source for intuitive explanation of degrees of freedom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4otEcA3gjLk&list=WL&index=37&t=236s)
      
      - this video explains that y=mx+c needs exactly 2 points to define a line, x being the single-feature independent variable and y being the dependent variable.
      - this causes the model to yield ![This is the rendered form of the equation. You can not edit this directly. Right click will give you the option to save the image, and in most browsers you can drag the image onto your desktop or another program.](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cdpi%7B120%7D%20R%5E2) =1 , hence the relation between y and x cannot be assessed, and only after the addition of the 3rd point is when the model gains some *freedom* to assess the strength of the relation between y and x 
      - **Note** : we are trying to **draw the best-fit line**, i.e. minimum sum of least squares.
      - anything less than this imparts freedom for the regression line itself, i.e. for n = 1 point, infinite number of lines can pass through this point, hence infinite values of m and c, hence **no best-fit line possible**.
      - The problem is that when we have more parameters than observations(n > p), there is a risk of overfitting the training dataset
      
    - we assume the feature vector X to be ![This is the rendered form of the equation. You can not edit this directly.

    - as [machinelearningmastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/degrees-of-freedom-in-machine-learning/) says, : "*degrees of freedom = number of independent values â€“ number of statistics*" , here the **number of independent values is n**(since n dependent variables are to be predicted) and **p number of statistics**  , i.e. number of constraints employed.
      - for instance, in [simple linear regression](#optimal-lr), we get the 2 listed constraints , hence the remaining degrees of freedom becomes *n-2* , which is also seen in its corresponding expression of [RMSE](#bessel).
